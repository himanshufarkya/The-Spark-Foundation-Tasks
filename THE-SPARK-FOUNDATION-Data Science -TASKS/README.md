### # Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
_Please click on the images on right side to view my solution._

1. Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
1. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
1. Data can be found at [http://bit.ly/w](http://bit.ly/w)
1. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
1. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

### # Task-7: Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis (Level - Advanced)
_Please click on the images on right side to view my solution._

**NOTE : If you face any issue over dataset then please refer to the thread of [Issue #2](https://github.com/kritika-srivastava/The-Sparks-Foundation-Tasks/issues/2).**

1. Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines.
1. Stock to analyze and predict SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)
1. Download historical stock prices from [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/?guccounter=1)
1. Download textual (news) data from [https://bit.ly/36fFPI6](https://bit.ly/36fFPI6)
1. Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then combine the findings to create a hybrid model.
